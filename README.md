# SuperMileageVehicle — UMass SMV Team Contributions

This repository includes the code and written contributions I developed as part of the UMass SuperMileage Vehicle (SMV) engineering team. Our goal was to design and optimize a high-efficiency competition vehicle, combining embedded systems, sensor integration, and real-time data collection.

## Overview
The primary work I worked on centers around creating a 2-way pipe between the Raspberry Pi 5 and a remote website. The pipe would enable real time data transfer between the Pi and the website. This would enable both the team and the driver to take note of the critical data required in real time to ensure maximum efficiency on track as well as competition day.

## Key Contributions
- Developed a Websocket Connection between a Website and the Raspberry Pi
- Designed the website that would act as the client in the Websocket relation  
- Integrates Tailscale into our environment, which ensured robust and guranteed connection between the Raspberry Pi and the Website   

## Technologies & Tools
- Embedded C  
- Microcontroller-based development   
- Real-time system constraints  

## Purpose
This work reflects my hands-on experience in embedded systems engineering within a real multidisciplinary team. The project emphasized reliability, safety, energy efficiency, and collaborating across hardware and software boundaries.
